# rainfall
☔️ Rainfall is an ISO challenge slightly more complex than Snow Crash. I'll have to dive deep into reverse engineering, learn to reconstruct a code, and understand it to detect faults. Will I reach the last level?

## Summary
This project is an introduction to the exploitation of [ELF-like binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format).

## Introduction
As a developer, I might have to work on software that will be used by hundreds of persons.
I have learned to develop more or less complex programs without taking security into account.
With this project, I will realize that my programs are full of breaches that can be easily exploitable by some malicious users. But here’s a good news: I can avoid them very easily!
Once I am through with this project, not only will I have avoided these pitfalls, but I will have a clearer understanding of the RAM. And this will really help me design a bugless program!

## Objectives
This project aims to further my knowledge in the world of ELF-like binary exploitation in in i386 system.
The more or less complex methods I will use will give me a new perspective on IT in general but mostly raise my awareness on issues coming from programming common malpractice. I will be challenged during this project. I have to overcome these challenges by myself. The way I’ll be dealing with these challenges must be mines and MINES ONLY. The point is to help me develop some logic and acquire reflexes that will help
me all along my career. Before asking for help, ask myself if I have factored all the possibilities in.
